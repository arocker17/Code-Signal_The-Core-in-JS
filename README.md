## JavaScrip codes

Codes I made on the Code Signal webpage: https://app.codesignal.com/profile/armando_r_cru Those codes are meant to help any new beginner programmer and help them on how to solve those queries/problems. Of course, those are for public usage, I have received help from other creators and will contribute similarly. Thank you for visiting and using my contributions.
